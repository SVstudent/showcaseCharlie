# CharlieTourGuy
## Overview
**CharlieTourGuy** transforms travel research from a lonely list-reading exercise into a lively conversation with a knowledgeable local friend. It combines a rich 3D map interface with a responsive AI persona named "Charlie." You can walk through the streets of San Francisco on Street View while asking Charlie questions like *"What's that building?"* or *"Tell me a fun fact about this area,"* receiving instant, voice-to-voice responses that are aware of your virtual location.
## Key Features
-   **Context-Aware Conversations**: Charlie knows where you are looking on the map and answers questions based on your specific visual context.
-   **Immersive 3D Exploration**: Seamless integration of Google Maps 3D view and Street View for a "virtual walk."
-   **Real-Time Voice Interaction**: Powered by **ElevenLabs Turbo v2**, Charlie speaks with natural intonation and near-instant latency.
-   **Personalized Memory**: The app remembers your conversation history to make smarter recommendations as the tour progresses.
## How It Works
The architecture blends modern frontend interactivity with a powerful AI backend:
1.  **Frontend**: Built with **React** and the Google Maps API, managing the visual state and capturing user microphone input.
2.  **AI Orchestration**: The backend (built on **Raindrop Framework**) processes speech and determines intent using **Vultr Serverless Inference**.
3.  **Voice Synthesis**: We send the generated text to **ElevenLabs** API to synthesize Charlie's distinctive voice, streaming the audio back to the user instantly.
## Technologies Used
-   **ElevenLabs API**: We use `Turbo v2` for ultra-low latency Text-to-Speech and custom voice cloning for the "Charlie" persona.
-   **Raindrop (LiquidMetal)**: Provides the serverless backend, SmartMemory for conversation context, and SmartBucket for tour data.
-   **Vultr Inference**: Powers the LLM generation logic.
-   **Google Maps Platform**: Delivers the 3D tiling and Street View imagery.
## Future Plans
We plan to bring Charlie into the real world with an **AR Mobile App**, allowing users to point their phones at landmarks and hear Charlie's stories on the spot. We also aim to expand the dataset to cover Paris, Tokyo, and New York.
